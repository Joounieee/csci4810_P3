# csci4810_P3
Program 3 for my CSCI 4810 (Computer Graphics) course. I created a UI that lets the user perform matrix operations on images made of lines through an inputted text file.
I use the Bresenham's Algorithm and Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping algorithm. The images are transferred from the screen coordinate system to the eye coordinate system.
